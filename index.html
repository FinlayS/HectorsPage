            Hector played the starring role in the popular children's TV sitcom, Hector's House during the mid to late 60's. The program enjoyed the prime 5 minute slot  before the news came on signalling the end of children's TV for the day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The 3 strong cast played out stories where Hector tried to help his two neighbors, ZsaZsa and Kiki. This usually generated ample opportunity for the aforementioned to ridicule Hector's every attempt at kindness This, he eventually summed up by generally declaring "what a big old bloodhound buffoon I am".
        </p>
        <p>
            Hector only tolerated this behaviour because he had a keen eye on ZsaZsa and although he bitterly disliked Kiki (Although she was never invited, she often entered Hector's garden by climbing a ladder or crawling through a she'd made in his garden wall). She was befriended by ZsaZsa who generally felt superior to her and sorry for her at the same time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The underlying moral messages delivered in each episode were to be valuable life lessons for both boys and girls of that era.

            <p>The show ended after one season which ran for five years, between 1965 and 1970 and produced 78 episodes.</p>
            
            <p>This was extrodinarily long for a series commision even by standards in the 60s when the BBC had unlimited funds and an (almost) complete monopoly on the available TV channels.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Fought like cat and dog</h2>
            <p>Zsazsa was Hector's neighbour and best friend as far as the program went.</p>
                
            <p>Off set, they were fierce enemies, when questioned on the subject neither of them could justify or explain why there was such animosity between them.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div id="text-id-3">
        <div>
            <h2>LSD?..KFC!!</h2>
            <p>Kiki was Hector's other neighbour who was introduced to the plot after a couple of episodes. Her character "worked at the BBC in programming" which never really explained why she was always clad in staff canteen uniform. </p>
                
            <p>Her character in plot was weak and it was romoured in certain circles that Hector only kept her on-set due to hallucinogenic properties excreted from her skin. </p>
                    
            <p>Midshoot, they were once caught in his trailer performing a private act. Zsazsa, who discovered them, was shoved aside as Hector stormed past proclaiming, "It's true!, they do taste of chicken".</p>

    <div id="text-id-4">
        <div>
            <h2>Legless</h2>
            <p>Hector was said to be embarrased about his legs and would throw a fit of rage during filming if he ever suspected they were in-shot.</p>
                
            <p>So as not to as not to draw attention to himself, he made this a rule for all the members of the cast. </p>
            
            <p>Zsazsa, who was also a part time yoga instructor and proud of her atheletic physique, was know to be very unhappy about this. This was the mid sixties when sexism was rife in the industry and lead female roles were difficult to sucure. </p>
                
            <p>Hector's ban on lower appendages on screen may well have been a contributing factor to her lack of appearances in any other TV shows.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Ye tak the high road</h2>
            <p>The show was filmed for other countries and often on location.</p>
            
            <p>Hector travelled to Scotland to film a Gaelic version but returned after only one episode. He claimed the bitter cold and continually damp climate was not good for his coat.</p>
                
            <p>While there, he was contractually obliged to wear traditional dress and may even have had to "go commando" whist wearing the a kilt.</p>

            <p>We can only ever speculate however as the kilt was never in shot for entire episode.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div id="text-id-6">
        <div>
            <h2>World domination</h2>
            <p>Hector starred in an episode of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goodies_Rule_%E2%80%93_O.K.%3F">The Goodies</a> where he was to play an evil dictator who takes over the world. 
                
            <p>During casting for the episode, Bill Oddie accidentally commisioned Dougal from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcnKvqDMnKU"> The Magic Roundabout</a> and refused to acknowledge his mistake even when Tim Brooke-Taylor tried to point this out even when Dougal turned up on set.</p>

            <p>The plot was changed to avoid legal dispute where a number of other childrens TV characters were cast who then formed a government that tried to conquer the world.</p>
            
            <p>This was a low point for Hector and he abstained from any promotion activities around the episode</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div id="text-id-7">
        <div>
            <h2>The curtain closes</h2>
            <p>Hector was already 6 when season one began filming.</p>
                
            <p>He refused to film a second series citing that he "just wasn't up for it" but rumours were rife that by the time he would have completed a second series, Hector would be well into mid 80s in <a href="https://www.pedigree.com/dog-care/dog-age-calculator"> dog years</a>.</p> 
            
            <p>Perhaps this was what Hector was referring to when he stated that he wasn't up for it? He refused to expand any further however.</p>
