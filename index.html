The show ended after one season which ran for five years, between 1965 and 1970 and produced 78 episodes. This was extrodinarily long for a series commision even by standards in the 60s when the BBC had unlimited funds and an (almost) complete monopoly on the available tv channels.

Hector was already 6 when season one began filming. He refused to film a second series citing that he "just wasn't up for it" but rumours were rife that by the time he would have completed a second series, Hector would be well into mid 80s in <a href="https://www.pedigree.com/dog-care/dog-age-calculator"> dog years</a>. Perhaps this was what Hector was referring to when he stated that he wasn't up for it? He refused to expand any further however.
